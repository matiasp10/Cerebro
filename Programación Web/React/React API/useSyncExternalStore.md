```jsx
const state = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot[, getServerSnapshot]);
```

`useSyncExternalStore` is a hook recommended for reading and subscribing from external data sources in a way that’s compatible with concurrent rendering features like selective hydration and time slicing.

This method returns the value of the store and accepts three arguments:

-   `subscribe`: function to register a callback that is called whenever the store changes.
-   `getSnapshot`: function that returns the current value of the store.
-   `getServerSnapshot`: function that returns the snapshot used during server rendering.

The most basic example simply subscribes to the entire store:

```jsx
const state = useSyncExternalStore(store.subscribe, store.getSnapshot);
```

However, you can also subscribe to a specific field:

```jsx
const selectedField = useSyncExternalStore(
  store.subscribe,
  () => store.getSnapshot().selectedField,
);
```

When server rendering, you must serialize the store value used on the server, and provide it to `useSyncExternalStore`. React will use this snapshot during hydration to prevent server mismatches:

```jsx
const selectedField = useSyncExternalStore(
  store.subscribe,
  () => store.getSnapshot().selectedField,
  () => INITIAL_SERVER_SNAPSHOT.selectedField,
);
```

> Note:
> 
> `getSnapshot` must return a cached value. If getSnapshot is called multiple times in a row, it must return the same exact value unless there was a store update in between.
> 
> A shim is provided for supporting multiple React versions published as `use-sync-external-store/shim`. This shim will prefer `useSyncExternalStore` when available, and fallback to a user-space implementation when it’s not.
> 
> As a convenience, we also provide a version of the API with automatic support for memoizing the result of getSnapshot published as `use-sync-external-store/with-selector`.
